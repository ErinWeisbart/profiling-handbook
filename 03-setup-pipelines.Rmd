# Setup pipelines and images
## Get CellProfiler pipelines

Cell Painting pipelines are stored in a GitHub repo. If you are using a new pipeline, be sure to add it to the repo first. Follow instructions on https://github.com/broadinstitute/imaging-platform-pipelines for adding new pipelines.

```sh
cd ~/efs/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/
mkdir github
cd github/
git clone git@github.com:broadinstitute/imaging-platform-pipelines.git
cd ..
ln -s github/imaging-platform-pipelines pipelines
```

This is the resulting structure of `github` and `pipelines` on EFS (one level below `workspace`):
```
├── github
│    └── imaging-platform-pipelines
└── pipelines -> github/imaging-platform-pipelines
```

## Specify pipeline set

```
PIPELINE_SET=cellpainting_a549_20x_with_bf_phenix_bin1
```

Ensure that, both, `analysis.cppipe` as well as `illum.cppipe` are present for this set. As well, each pipeline should have a `_without_batchfile` version of it in the same directory. It's easy to create such a version of the pipeline - simply copy it and set `enabled=False` for the `CreateBatchFiles` module (like [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/imaging-platform-pipelines/blob/master/cellpainting_u2os_20x_imagexpress/illum_without_batchfile.cppipe#L384)).


## Prepare images

Create soft link to the image folder, which should be uploaded on S3.
Note that the relevant S3 bucket has been mounted at `/home/ubuntu/bucket/`.

Troubleshooting: The folder structure for `images` differs between `S3` and `EFS`. This can be potentially confusing. However note that the step below simply creates a soft link to the images in S3; no files are copied. Further, when `pe2loaddata` is run (later in the process, via `create_csv_from_xml.sh`) it resolves the soft link, so the the resulting LoadData CSV files end up having the paths to the images as they exist on S3. Thus the step below (of creating a softlink) only serves the purpose of making the `images` folder have a similar structure as the others (e.g. `load_data_csv`, `metadata`, `analysis`).

```sh
cd ~/efs/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/
mkdir images
cd images
ln -s ~/bucket/projects/${PROJECT_NAME}/${BATCH_ID}/images/ ${BATCH_ID}
cd ..
```

This is the resulting structure of the image folder on EFS (one level below `workspace`):
```
└── images
    └── 2016_04_01_a549_48hr_batch1 -> /home/ubuntu/bucket/projects/2015_10_05_DrugRepurposing_AravindSubramanian_GolubLab_Broad/2016_04_01_a549_48hr_batch1/images/
```

This is the structure of the image folder on S3 (one level above `workspace`, under the folder `2016_04_01_a549_48hr_batch1`.)
Here, only one plate (`SQ00015167__2016-04-21T03_34_00-Measurement1`) is show but there are often many more.

```
└── images
    └── 2016_04_01_a549_48hr_batch1
        └── SQ00015167__2016-04-21T03_34_00-Measurement1
            ├── Assaylayout
            ├── FFC_Profile
            └── Images
                ├── r01c01f01p01-ch1sk1fk1fl1.tiff
                ├── r01c01f01p01-ch2sk1fk1fl1.tiff
                ├── r01c01f01p01-ch3sk1fk1fl1.tiff
                ├── r01c01f01p01-ch4sk1fk1fl1.tiff
                └── r01c01f01p01-ch5sk1fk1fl1.tiff
```

`SQ00015167__2016-04-21T03_34_00-Measurement1` is the typical nomenclature followed by Broad Chemical Biology Platform for plate names.
`Measurement1` indicates the first attempt to image the plate. `Measurement2` indicates second attempt and so on.
Ensure that there's only one folder corresponding to a plate before running `create_csv_from_xml.sh` below
(it gracefully exits if not).

## Create list of plates

Create a text file with one plate id per line.

```sh
mkdir -p scratch/${BATCH_ID}/

PLATES=$(readlink -f ~/efs/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/scratch/${BATCH_ID}/plates_to_process.txt)

echo "SQ00015130 SQ00015168 SQ00015167 SQ00015166 SQ00015165"|tr " " "\n" > ${PLATES}
```

## Create LoadData CSVs

The script below works only for Phenix microscopes – it reads a standard XML file (`Index.idx.xml`) and writes a LoadData csv file. For other microscopes, you will have to roll your own. The script below requires `config.yml`, which specifies (1) the mapping between channel names in `Index.idx.xml` and the channel names in the CellProfiler pipelines (2) metadata to extract from `Index.idx.xml`. Ensure that all the metadata fields defined in `config.yml` are present in the `Index.idx.xml`.

```sh
cd ~/efs/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/software/cellpainting_scripts/
pyenv shell 2.7.12
parallel \
  --max-procs ${MAXPROCS} \
  --eta \
  --joblog ../../log/${BATCH_ID}/create_csv_from_xml.log \
  --results ../../log/${BATCH_ID}/create_csv_from_xml \
  --files \
  --keep-order \
  ./create_csv_from_xml.sh \
  -b ${BATCH_ID} \
  --plate {1} :::: ${PLATES}
cd ../../
```

This is the resulting structure of `load_data_csv` on EFS (one level below `workspace`). Files for only `SQ00015167` are shown.
```
└── load_data_csv
    └── 2016_04_01_a549_48hr_batch1
        └── SQ00015167
            ├── load_data.csv
            └── load_data_with_illum.csv
```

`load_data.csv` will be used by `illum.cppipe`.
`load_data_with_illum.csv` will be used by `analysis.cppipe`.
When creating `load_data_with_illum.csv`, the script assumes a specific location for the output folder, discussed below (see discussion on ``--illum_pipeline_name`` option).
