## Download Software

You may need to authenticate your GitHub account to be able to clone these:

(Note that cellpainting_scripts is currently a private repository; contact our team for access)

```sh
cd ~/efs/${PROJECT_NAME}/workspace/
mkdir software
cd software
git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/pe2loaddata.git
git clone https://github.com/CellProfiler/Distributed-CellProfiler.git

cd ..
```

If these repos have already been cloned, `git pull` to make sure they are up to date.

This is the resulting structure of `software` on EFS (one level below `workspace`):
```
└── software
    ├── Distributed-CellProfiler
    └── pe2loaddata
```
